***For students enrolled in STAT 451, as Canvas is still down today, please see the [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ElrGCZp4vbZRT-98xfwtGTkbdZaNCIK-?usp=drive_link) for the course material for this week and the [Zoom link](https://washington.zoom.us/j/97864432674) for Tues Oct. 21st class.***  

I am interested in statistical analysis and time series forecasting, and more broadly data science using complex data across space and time.

Currently, I am developing mathematical and statistical methods and codes for population health statistical surveys at the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)](https://www.healthdata.org/).

Previously, I was working on forecasting housing market indicators at [Zillow](https://www.zillowgroup.com). 

Before that, I worked on low-frequency seismic data and numerical inversion of earthquake models at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu) and the [French Geological Survey (BRGM)](https://www.brgm.fr/en).
