I am interested in statistical analysis and time series forecasting, and more broadly data science using complex data across space and time.

Currently, I am developing mathematical and statistical methods and codes for population health statistical surveys at the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)](https://www.healthdata.org/).

Previously, I was working on forecasting housing market indicators at [Zillow](https://www.zillowgroup.com). 

Before that, I worked on low-frequency seismic data and numerical inversion of earthquake models at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu) and the [French Geological Survey (BRGM)](https://www.brgm.fr/en).
